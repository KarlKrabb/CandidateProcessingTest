# CandidateProcessingTest

- Thank you for considering my application and taking the time to review my test response.

## My Idea
- For this test i noticed that a simple console application was sufficient so that is what i created, it is a simple object oriented solution that contains a class that takes in the candidate.json when initialized and contains a simple filter method that takes in two arguments one for the job title and one for the minimum years experience and returns a list of contacts based on the filter criteria.
- I hope the object oriented nature and abtraction is clear and the reusability of the classes indicates some level of SOLID design principals.

## IDE
- I used VS Code for this simple example, if i were to write a .Net Core web API i would use Visual Studio.

## How To Run
- Clone this repository in VS Code
- in terminal run "dotnet run"

## Testing The Code
- in terms of testing one could write another test class to pass a default candidate object into the Candidate filter create test cases for filter criteria and validate the responses.
